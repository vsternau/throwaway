## Week Two Reflections  
This week I learned A LOT. I've **never** used any of the applications/websites we are using.  
GitBash, GitHub, MarkDown, and Visual Studio Code are all new to me!  

I never know you could do so much with _only one_ application.   
  
- A terminal is a program that runs other text programs through written commands.  
- GitBash is an example of a terminal

Git is a control system.  

### GitHub  
GitHub is a website that hosts repositories.  
1. GitHub seems extremely helpful for anyone who is writing code.
2. It's easy to share codes/repositories between multiple people and multiple workstations.

Being able to actively push/share code between multiple people is amazing.   

I am definitely looking forward to learning throughout this class!  
Thank you so much for all your help so far. :)
